# AI_Agents
The repository was created for the purpose of learning how to program AI Agents. The repository contains (and will be added in the future) projects for the purpose of learning and exploring artificial intelligence. 

🔍 Key Steps
1. Load environment variables to keep API keys secure.
2. Initialize Tavily Search Tool to fetch search results.
3. Get ReAct prompt for agent logic.
4. Configure OpenAI model for deterministic responses.
5. Create and run the agent to answer queries.

🌟 Outcome
This project demonstrated the power of combining LangChain with OpenAI and external tools. Excited to explore more with AI agents!
